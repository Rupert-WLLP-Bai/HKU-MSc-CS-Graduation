\chapter{Conclusion}

In this study, we address the issue of entangled semantic embeddings and propose \textbf{Multi-faceted Semantic Disentanglement for CTR Prediction (MSD-CTR)}. MSD-CTR utilizes \textit{DSTopic} to extract and disentangle multi-faceted knowledge from textual information through a disentangled topic model. Additionally, MSD-CTR employs \textit{TopicDRL} to incorporate the learned disentangled multi-faceted knowledge into CTR prediction by introducing alignment losses.

We implement our method based on two foundational CTR models and conduct extensive experiments on four CTR datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we perform qualitative and ablation studies to validate the disentanglement capability and assess the impact of different components of MSD-CTR.
